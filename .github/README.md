## score
`score` is a scoreboard centered around scoring service uptime.
It comes with a modern HTML5 interface and is designed to be easily 
deployable. `score` leverages nmap to perform service checks, and
takes nmap XML output files (`-oX`) for specifying teams to monitor
during the deploment stage.
